Let me write the solution of this problem.

Suppose, There is a Krishna on a shop. He had 3 bowls in front of him the first bowl contains infinite coins of 1, the second bowl contains infinite coins of 2 and the third one contains an infinite number of coin 3 and someone came to him and asked him all possible ways of changing 10Rs. Note.
Krishna was very good in dynamic programming he has broken down that problem into smaller problems.
1. First, he had to find out all possible ways of changing 1Rs. note and learn it.
2. Second, he had to find out all possible ways of changing 2Rs 1 + 1(already knew).
....
...
..

10. Now, he could tell him there is dp[10] number of ways to change a 10Rs note.

Although, Customer was smart enough. Now, he told him in this solution you considered 1-way multiple times.


Krishna it's masti time.
Immediately change his solution.

Now he first finds out all possible ways of changing 1..N Rs. by using only coins[1].
and then he finds out all possible ways of changing 1..N Rs by using coin[1] which he already knew, therefore, he would have to find out all possible ways of changing notes using coin[2] and use previous result DONE.
